# interview_question


Short answer:

Know the job role and position.!
For SDE Interview preparation:

Learn all the data structures and knows it best/average/worst case time complexity.
Also learn it's usage and real time application
Personally I will suggest you to refer Geeksforgeeks or any similar sites and solve plenty of problems from each DS. (Note: The purpose is to get an idea how to approach problems in different ways! Don't expect similar problems during Interview.)
First try to solve the problem by yourself. Once you get enough solution, check whether your solution is optimal.
It take few years to solve all the problems in geeksforgeeks :P The purpose is not solve higher number of problems, instead try to learn the techniques in each problems and solve maximum of 3 to 5 problems in each technique.
Don't just memorize the solution. Write the code in paper and do dry run.
Once you are done with preparation. Go through past Interview experience in Geeksforgeeks. There are 300+ Amazon Interview experience shared in Geeksforgeeks. Go through atleast 25+ Interview experience to know if you are ready for interview.
If you are not ready, solve few more problems in those areas where you lag.
Once you are fully confident, contact any amazonian through LinkedIn for referrals.

Know the job role!
We have many tech roles, not all require data structure knowledge.
Choose the role which suits you. Mentioning few roles:
Software Developer Engineer (SDE), Front End Engineer (FEE), Data Engineer (DE), Quality Assurance Engineer (QAE), Software Support Engineer (SE)
Since most of the other answers are related to SDE role, I’m providing tips for SDE.

SDE-1 (Entry Level Developer)

We expect SDE-1 to be strong in Problem Solving, Coding, Data Structures and Algorithms. (Good to have Class/System design skills, but not mandatory).

You should be able to come up with different approaches for a problem and should trade-off between those to choose optimal approach.
You should be able to convert your approach into working code. Not a problem if you make bug in code. But you should identify the bug by yourself when pointed out the failure case.
You should be able to pick up suitable DS to solve the problem.
For example: You should use Stack for Parentheses Validation problem rather than Heap or not suitable DS ;)
SDE-2 (Mid level developer)

In addition to SDE-1 competency, Class/System design skills will be checked for SDE-2
The interviewer’s expectation is not to know the solution before, instead we expect candidates to solve the problems on the spot. I know lot of people who didn’t prepare much for interview and still able to arrive at optimal approach during interviews.

Learn different data structures and it’s usage/application. Also learn different algorithms/techniques used in those data structures.

Interview Preparation

Regarding the preparation, personally I will suggest you to refer geeksforgeeks site.

Start with a data structure, try to solve all the problems under that and try to learn/understand different techniques in that DS.

For example.

Array is simple data structure, but there are plenty of techniques/algorithms available to solve array problems optimally. Mentioning few techniques below.

Binary Search
Will be helpful to solve few sorted array problems. To optimize the solution from O(n) to O(lg n)
Kadane's Algorithm
Helpful to solve the subarray problems in O(n)
Two pointer technique (Left to Right traversal)
Sliding window problems.
Two pointer technique (Right to Left traversal)
Example : Two sum pair
Making use of DS like Stack/Queue/Heap to solve the problems.
Example : Sliding window maximum problem, Next Greater element , Kth largest element problem.
Similarly solve problems in different data structures.

Thank you!!
